For the Burgers, case, run the Jupyter python notebook ```Burgers_eigenanalysis_paper.ipynb``` that loads model inference data from ```Expt1.jl``` and plots eigenanalysis.

Since the files are too big, the files "telemetry_caseA_expt1_inference_test.npz, telemetry_caseA_expt1_inference_train.npz" in Expt 1 and "telemetry_caseA_expt2b_inference_test.npz	telemetry_caseA_expt2b_inference_train.npz" in Expt 2 are saved in a separate link. Download them here and place it in the directory before running the notebook
 

If you choose to run Expt1.jl, be aware it will take several hours to run on a laptop. This code does both the training and inference in a single script and saves to disk.
