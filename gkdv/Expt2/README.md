1. To train model, run Julia code Expt2.jl. Caution: This may take several hours (~12-16 hours) on a laptop.  The output of the code will be the trained checkpoint ```ckpt_expt2.jld2``` which is already placed in the dir for your convenience.
2. To perform inference with the trained model run ```analyze_expt2.ipynb``` Jupyter notebook with Julia. It will plot various figures in the paper, and more general analysis plots for inference. 
3. We now compute Jacobians for further analysis, from both the ground truth and the learned model. Run ```jacobians_analysis_expt2.ipynb``` Jupyter notebook with Julia. It will compute Jacobians and save to disk as "jacobian_gKdV_caseB_dict.npz" for the next analysis. Will also perform some basic diagnostics and print to screen.
4. The Jacobians are now loaded from disk and analyzed with Python Jupyter notebook ```gKdV_Eigenanalysis_paper.ipynb```.
